## Current State
This application is not considered to be production ready yet. It's in an MVP state where it runs, but unexpected errors and data corruption should be expected. Continue to report bugs, but be warned that this application is not yet stable.

### Roadmap to 1.0
The main focus for this application to get to version 1.0 is around stability. Error handling and unit tests will be added and fleshed out to make the overall experience much more stable and reliable.
